### Homework

* Begin thinking about your midterm! You will be creating a fully functioning website, styled with CSS. It is up to you if it is multiple pages or just one HTML page, but every design element must be well considered. On *Oct 11*, you will be presenting your midterm ideas and getting critique. Your presentation must include:

    * A concise elevator pitch: What are you making? Why? Your content should be well considered. You should be able to articulate the need for the website you will be creating. "It looks cool" is not enough of a reason.
    
    * A wirefame of your home page
    
    * A mood board of images, inspirations, color palette, etc. that demonstrate the look and feel
    
    * Your midterms will be presented on Oct 18
