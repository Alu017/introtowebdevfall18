### Homework

* Review Git/Github, and make sure you are clear on how to initialize, stage, commit, and push files to your Github repo. If anything here is confusing, this could make a GREAT learning log! If anything is still not working, then please reach out with specific questions ASAP.

* Read [The Difference Between ID and Class](https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/)
