## Welcome to Day 1!

* Introductions

* Go over syllabus & class requirements. This is a contract between students + professor, so it is important we're all on the same page!

* Learning Goals:
  * Why am I in this class? Why have I chosen to be sitting here NOW?
  
  * What do I hope I will learn?

  * What are my goals?
  
  * What content do I think will help me accomplish my learning goals?
  
* What is Web Development?
  

### Homework: 

1. Each student will choose 1 movement, artist, or designer for a 5-min presentation to the class. Share a brief introduction to the movements, artists, or designers and at least 3 images for each (for a total of at least 6 images). This presentation will count toward your class participation grade.

2. Complete a Learning Log that will help you begin to learn the introductory concepts of HTML and CSS.
